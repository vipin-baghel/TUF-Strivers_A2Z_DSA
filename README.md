## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

-   **`👤 user-name/`**: Folder dedicated to a particular user.
-   **`📝 Notes/`**: Folder dedicated to sharing study resources.
-   **`📁 Sample_folder_structure/`**: Folder to get you started quickly.

### Explanation of Folders:

1. **📝 Notes**: Contains general notes and patterns relevant to coding problems. Use `coding_patterns.md` to document any patterns or important notes.

2. **👤 [your-username]**: Replace `[your-username]` with your GitHub username or preferred identifier. This is where all your contributions will be organized.

    - **1-basic**: This folder covers the basics, including hashing, maths, patterns, recursion, and generate. Each subfolder contains specific problems and their solutions.

        - **hashing**: Code related to hashing problems.
            - Example: `count-frequency-of-each-element-in-the-array.js`
        - **maths**: Basic mathematical problems like counting digits, checking prime numbers, etc.
            - Example: `check-if-a-number-is-prime-or-not.js`
        - **pattern**: Problems related to generating patterns.
            - Example: `pattern.js`
        - **recursion**: Recursive problems, including factorial, Fibonacci, etc.
            - Example: `factorial-of-a-number.js`

    - **2-sorting-technique**: This folder covers different sorting algorithms. Each file represents a specific sorting algorithm.

        - Example: `quick-sort.js`

    - and so on...

### 📑 File Naming Conventions

-   Use **kebab-case** or **snake_case** or any case of your choice for file names. For example, `check-if-a-number-is-prime-or-not.js`.
-   Ensure that file names clearly indicate the problem or algorithm they solve.

### 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

1. **🍴 Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **📥 Clone the forked repository** to your local machine.
3. Create your username's folder inside the repository, or directly use the `📁 Sample_folder_structure` folder as a template.
4. **🔧 Add or modify code** according to the folder structure and file naming conventions.
5. **✅ Commit your changes** with a clear message. Example: `Added solution for GCD problem`.
6. **📤 Push** the changes to your forked repository.
7. Create a **🔃 Pull Request (PR)** to the main repository.

### 📝 Example Contribution

If you’re adding a solution to the "Check if a number is prime" problem, navigate to your folder and place the solution file in `1-basic/maths/check-if-a-number-is-prime-or-not.js`.

### 📚 Resources

-   **Refer and add materials** in the `Notes` folder to share helpful study resources and insights with others.
-   Make use of the DSA A to Z Sheet as your guide.

### 🔍 Conclusion

Consistency is key! By following this structure, we ensure that the repository remains organized, accessible, and valuable to everyone in the learning community.
