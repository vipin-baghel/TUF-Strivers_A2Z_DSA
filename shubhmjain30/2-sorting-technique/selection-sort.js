/**
 * Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, write a program to implement the Selection sorting algorithm.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: N = 6, array[] = {13,46,24,52,20,9}
 * Output: 9,13,20,24,46,52
 * Explanation: After sorting the array is: 9, 13, 20, 24, 46, 52
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: N=5, array[] = {5,4,3,2,1}
 * Output: 1,2,3,4,5
 * Explanation: After sorting the array is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
