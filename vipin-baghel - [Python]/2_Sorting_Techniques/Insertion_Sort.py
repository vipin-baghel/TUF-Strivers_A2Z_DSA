## Problem Statement: Implement the Insertion sorting algorithm.
# Input: N = 6, array[] = {13,46,24,52,20,9}
# Output: 9,13,20,24,46,52
#
#
# The algorithm steps are as follows:
#
# Start with the second element: Assume the first element is already sorted. Take the second element and compare it with the first.
# Insert the element: If the second element is smaller, swap it with the first. Now, the first two elements are sorted.
# Move to the next element: Take the third element and compare it with the elements before it. Insert it into its correct position among the sorted elements.
# Repeat: Continue this process for each element in the array, inserting each one into its correct position among the sorted elements.
